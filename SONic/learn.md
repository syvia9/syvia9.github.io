# SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) is a free and open source network operating system based on Linux and developed by Microsoft and the Open Compute Project.[1][2][3] SONiC includes the networking software components necessary for a fully functional L3 device[4] and was designed to meet the requirements of a cloud data center. It allows cloud operators to share the same software stack across hardware from different switch vendors.[3][4]
