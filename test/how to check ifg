1. Once, I found the IFGTX10 (slice 5 ifg 0) is always send packet,  then read a register
debug_device.read_register(gibraltar_tree.slice[5].ifg[0].ifgb.fc_cfg0)
periodic_int_en [23:0] = 0x0000001

the bit 0 is set to 1, it means enable the port 0 to send the last package periodly. so you see....

2. also in the above case, at the beginning, I have not set loopback in my test script, but the port (5/0/0) is already up:
mac_port.get_state()
10
the result 10 means it is link up

(the mac_port is created by the script already, the name maybe not the very same)
 you can also get it by yourself on real-time:
 mp0 = la_device.get_mac_port(0,1,8)
 mp0.get_state()
 
 I suspect the port has been set loopback, so I check:
mac_port.get_loopback_mode()
5

 
 result 5 means :Loopback at MAC port's PMA level, using core rate. 
 
 then I disable the loopback:
 mac_port.set_loopback_mode(0)
 
 mac_port.get_state()
10

it is still up:)

So I suspect there are some register is set to make serdis up, but I don't know
